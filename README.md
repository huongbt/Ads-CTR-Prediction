Ads Click Through Rate is the ratio of how many users clicked on an ad over total number of users viewed that ad. So Ad click prediction help companies in finding the best ad for their target audience. In this project, our task is to predict whether the user will click on the ad or not. We need to train a Machine Learning model to find relationships between the independent variables of all the users who click on ads.
